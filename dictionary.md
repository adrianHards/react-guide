### State

State is used to store and manage the changing data in a React component, and it determines how the component should render and behave. Unlike props, which are passed down from a parent component, the state is internal to a component and can be updated within the component using setState().

When the state changes, the component re-renders to reflect the new state. State is an important concept in React because it allows for dynamic and interactive user experiences.
