[What Does That Mean?](/dictionary.md)

## [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components, manage and update the state of an application, and efficiently render changes to the user interface. It uses a virtual DOM, a lightweight in-memory representation of the actual [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model). The virtual DOM acts as an intermediary between the React components and the DOM. 

When a change occurs in a React component, it updates the corresponding Virtual DOM node instead of directly updating the DOM. The Virtual DOM then performs a fast and efficient comparison of the current and updated Virtual DOM trees to determine the minimum number of changes necessary to update the actual DOM. This results in increased performance and improved stability (reducing the number of direct DOM manipulations reduces the risk of DOM-related issues such as browser crashes and slow performance).
